        <h1>Hello There!</h1>
        <p>
          I&apos;m Natalia, mum to two wild and beautiful boys and a passionate
          lifestyle photographer based in Dubai, UAE.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          I love to take advantage of the stunning outdoor locations this
          beautiful country has to offer but I also have a thing for in-home
          newborn and family photography too! Instead of formal portraits, I
          prefer to focus on story telling and connection, so I wonâ€™t ask you to
          pose, or even to make eye contact with me... I just want you to be
          yourselves and have fun while I capture some authentic memories for
          you and your family!You can find I photograph all sorts of
          photography, including weddings, seniors, families, events, maternity,
          engagement, and more. I&apos;ve been doing photography professionally
          since 2011, and love it! Contact me today for information on pricing
          and availability, or if you&apos;d just like to have a chat about some
          possibilities!
